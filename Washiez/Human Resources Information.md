Human Resources Information  




Staff Supervision
* As a Human Resources member, your main job is supervising the Supervision and Management Team. This includes issuing strikes, demotions, terminations, and looking for promotions to balance our ranks.
* Keep an eye on #punishment-requests. This is where Operations members will request punishments from HRD. One person should be checking it off, copying these punishments to #punishment-logs and sending the user the appropriate message.
* Collect session attendance, in-game minutes, cooldown, and other proof of activity and get approval from a Senior Corporate+ to promote a Shift Leader+. Once it is posted in #promotion-approval and approved, log it in #promotion-logs and make an announcement in-game or in #supervision-chat informing everyone of the promotion.
* You can accept/deny inactivity notices and excuses. Keep in mind that inactivity notices and excuses must both follow the format and can last up to two weeks. If you accept one, make sure to log it in the Trello under ‘Management Notices’. When the notice is over or someone ends it early, make sure to move it over to ‘Completed Management Notices’. If you are a Corporate Intern, you can ask a Junior Corporate+ to do so for you.
* Only corporates in the Operations Department can do tickets and check #ranker-requests. You should only be talking and helping with a ticket if you are pinged by someone in Operations.






Promotional Batches
* Promotional batches are hosted every Sunday, by a Senior Corporate+, to determine who gets promoted that week.
* A CHRO will put out a time-vote every Friday to see when it will be hosted, this is voted on by all department members. The majority of votes on a time will be when it will take place.
* At the time it is hosted, discussion for the promotional batch will take place in the #promotion-batches channel in the HRD discord server.
* Supervision Team and Management Team members can be promoted through this event, everyone attending should agree on promotions together. Cooldowns should be kept in mind when it comes to promoting each user.
* If someone is unable to attend this department event, they are able to put usernames of people who they think should be promoted in the google sheet, which is posted with the time-vote. They will be marked as ‘assisted’ and can still get credit for participation.


Activity Checks
* Every Sunday, the department will participate in reforms for the Management Team, which include Junior, Senior and Head Directors.
* A Senior Corporate+ will be chosen each week to lead activity checks. They will assign directors to everyone in the department (except if someone is on an inactivity notice), and will ensure that it runs smoothly.
* All department members can participate by gathering the minutes and sessions for the people they were assigned on Hyra.
* Directors should be checked for inactivity notices each week, this can be done by looking over the ‘Management Notices’ or ‘Completed Management Notices’ on the Trello. If you are a Corporate Intern, you can do ‘from: washiez123 in: inactivity notices’ in the search bar.
* Requirements for all Junior, Senior and Head Directors consist of both 2 training sessions and 120 minutes a week.
* If they complete half of their requirements, an inactivity reminder should be given out. If they continue to do so the next week, an inactivity warning is to be given out to the user.
* If they complete none of their requirements and that is their first offense, they are to be given an inactivity warning.
* If they continue to not complete requirements two weeks in a row, they can be demoted to their previous rank.


Mass Staff Trainings
* Monthly event that is hosted by a Head Corporate+.
* Planning will take place 1-2 weeks in advance.
* Like the name suggests, this event will be open to all members of the Supervision Team and Management Team. 
* Reviews important information with the addition of minigames. 
* Can collaborate with other departments as well. 
Management & Supervision Team Promotions 
* If you notice a member of ST is working exceptionally well, you can make a promotion recommendation in #promotion-approval if you are a Junior Corporate or Corporate Intern. Please remember to follow the correct format. 






  



* After your Senior Corporate has reviewed and ranked, they will react with a check. When they do so, you can edit the “Approval Status” to “Approved”.
Example:
  
* Afterwards, you will log the promotion in our main Washiez server. 
* With Management promotions, a Senior Corporate+ will make a promotion recommendation in #mgmt-recommendations on our HRD server. Ranks below SC can ask a SC to post the recommendation. 
* Department members will have the option to react with a check (if they approve) or decline with a cross on the promotion poll. 
* If more than half of the department and one Chief approves of the promotion, that individual can then be promoted. 
* The person who made the recommendation originally can then log the promotion in #promotion-logs. 

How to Be Active
   * Each week, you will be scored out of 10 and this will be given to you in our personal journals on our HRD server. Your score will determine how much you are paid.
   * To be active, you must have good activity in the following criteria:
   * Sending #strike-logs
   * Sending #promotion-logs
   * Participating in department activities.
   * You can get a bonus by having good session attendance, in-game minutes, or Discord activity. 
   * Not completing requirements and having bad activity will result in an inactivity reminder. If continued, you will be sent a final inactivity warning. If the inactivity continues, you will be demoted to your previous rank.


Weekly Requirements
   * Assist in HRD-needed tickets.
   * Help with promotions and punishments as needed.
   * Accept/deny inactivity notices.
   * Participate in department activities.










Additional Senior Corporate Responsibilities
   * Senior Corporates are expected to update the Trello and spreadsheet every time an Management Team promotion is approved. 
   * React with a emoji in #mgmt-recommendations to indicate that everything has been updated after approval.
