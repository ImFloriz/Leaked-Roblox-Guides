Corporate Guide
Departments
The Corporate Team is placed into one of three departments:
* Operations: Responds to tickets, ranks at trainings, helps recruit, and supervises the car wash to prevent blockages.
* Public Relations: Handles alliances, events, social media, and community interaction.
* Human Resources: Manages recruitment, promotions, punishments, activity checking, and staff management.


Weekly Requirements
Refer to your department handbook for weekly requirements. Not completing requirements without an approved inactivity notice will result in demotion.
Your department leader must approve inactivity notices. You can do so by messaging a department leader.


Handbooks
You must read through your department handbook to be familiar with your duties. Communicating regularly with your department is essential as well.
Department handbooks can be found in #corporate-information.
