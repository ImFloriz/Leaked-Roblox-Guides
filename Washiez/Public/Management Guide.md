Hyra
Activity Logging
Hyra is an activity tracking website. Once you’ve created an account, you will be able to view your activity and check if you’ve met the requirements.
* Website Link: Activity Tracking   


Inactivity Notices
The Inactivity Page on Hyra is used for filing an inactivity notice. This informs the Human Resources Department that you’re unable to complete your requirements. 
Consistently filing inactivity notices will result in your notices being denied. Do not abuse the system.
* Submit inactivity notices at least 24 hours in advance. If you submit an inactivity notice late, you must message a Human Resources Department member or your inactivity notice may be ignored.
* Notices up to 2 weeks have a 4-week cooldown, while those over 2 weeks require a 6-week cooldown. The maximum inactivity notice length is 4 weeks. An inactivity notice longer than 4 weeks requires approval from a Chief Human Resources Officer.
* Last-minute notices that are submitted late in the week will be denied.






Session Logging
Head Directors can log sessions on the Hyra activity page to meet weekly requirements. Only check off a session if you're available to log into Hyra at that time, and note your log in the designated channel. Sessions must be logged in order and cannot be skipped.
You can assign yourself as the logger for up to three sessions per week but may log additional sessions if they remain unchecked. Skipping, logging sessions late, or logging incorrectly may result in consequences.


In-Game Protocol
Punishments
Refer to the Compliance Trello for guidelines on handling rule violations at the car wash. It explains each type of punishment and how to enforce them. Use it as a reference, but adjust as needed for similar situations.
Access the Compliance Trello in #management-information

	5 Letter Rule
When using commands on other people, especially when kicking or banning, please be sure to use at least 5 letters of their usernames or their entire username depending on the length. This is to prevent users from being falsely kicked or banned. 
Management Requests
The #management-requests channel is what the “Management Requests” on the moderation panel refer to. As a member of the Management Team, your duty is to respond to these calls by reacting with a checkmark and using the user ID, username or Job ID to join the caller’s server. Where the “Management Call” panel is, you’ll see the teleport menu.
  



















In the text box, paste one of the provided methods in the #management-requests channel and you’ll be automatically referred to the callers server. If an error occurs saying ‘server full,’ click the teleport button multiple times until a position in that server opens up. If an error occurs saying “Attempted to teleport to a place that is restricted” assume you typed the user/ID wrong, the caller is in a private server or they’ve left the game. To ensure you still fulfill the request, you can track the server by pasting the job ID which doesn’t require the presence of the initial caller.


Remove Car Tool
One of your privileges in the Management Team is the remove car tool in-game. While we are lenient on using it for blockages, etc, you should still be trying to help cars to merge and in general cooperate with the customers. Removing rows of cars for no reason and classifying it as ‘stuck’ is not tolerated, you should work with them to tidy the lanes. It’s preferred you are on the scene at the time of removing vehicles to lessen the confusion and confliction aroused by our customers. Overall, you should use this ability to your own extent and only when necessary.


Entry Team Reports
If you witness an LR breaking the rules at either the Training Center or main game, you should be reporting them to a corporate. To do this, simply take some form of evidence (a screenshot or video), and open up a ticket. You should not be turning a blind eye to these instances, and letting them continue. 


Behavioral Expectations
Summary
When moderating, you are expected to use common sense to determine how to handle situations. Keep in mind you are still directors and must maintain standard etiquette when representing us in any of Washiez’ facilities. Entitlement or acting superior over other ranks is prohibited. We value each and every rank and trust that as members of the Management Team you can uphold these values while maintaining a good sense of authority when necessary. It should be your top priority to ensure that you can attend to issues that correspond to your duties and not try to interfere with the responsibilities of others.


Drama
As a member of the Management Team, teamwork is an essential factor that will aid your time as a director. You will communicate with other team members on a regular basis, and you should always be treating others with respect. There should be no adverse feelings or comments towards others, and you should be trying to get along with each and every member of the team. Trash talking, and engaging with any type of drama is strictly prohibited. Consequences will occur if you are caught engaging in any of these discussions.


Alternate Accounts 
Alternate accounts are accounts that belong to you, but are not used as a primary source. We ask that you are not using alternate, and third-party accounts to cause any form of disruption in any of our experiences, and establishment as a whole. Creating or using alternate accounts in a malicious manner will lead to consequences if you are caught doing so. You should also avoid creating and using alt accounts to cheat your weekly requirements, such as joining a training session on an alt account to gain a higher chance of receiving your desired role in order to gain a session.


Promotions
Promotions for the Management Team work differently to that of the Supervision Team. Unlike other ranks, directors are required to maintain stable activity in order to succeed through the ranks. After becoming a Head Director, a member of the Leadership Team will consider promoting you to Corporate Intern if you have proven yourself worthy. From there, you will undergo a trial period and various other tasks according to your department. 


Head Directors will be given a department interest form. If changes were to be made to department preferences, please be sure to notify a member of HRD and resubmit the department interest form. 


Resignation Process
If you wish to resign from your position, it is essential that you either DM a member of the Human Resources Department, or open a general support ticket through our support channel. You will then be guided through the process of stepping down from your position and being ranked to a new rank. You may receive an exclusive former role depending on if you meet certain requirements to deem you as eligible. Resignations cannot be undone, and if you are caught publicly announcing a resignation without running your plans through the Human Resources Department first, you will automatically be demoted and forced to resign. Jokes regarding resignations are not tolerated as well.


Alliance Visit Protocol
One of your privileges as a director consists of going on alliance visits. Please keep in mind when you are visiting, you’re representing Washiez as an entirety. You should always be on your best behavior and show proper etiquette as the face of our group. Additionally, do not go on an excessive amount of visits per day. The max amount of visits that are allowed is 2 per day, and all visits must be approved by a member of Public Relations Department prior to organizing one. To see more information on the protocol, refer to this announcement.
