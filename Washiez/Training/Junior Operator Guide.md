Junior Operator Guide  






Notes Stage
* Make sure everyone finds a seat and is in the correct group.
* As a trainer, you must keep the training going with minimal interruptions. Allow your ASSISTANTS to handle disruptions. 
Welcome to training! During this session, I will guide you through everything you need to know as you make your way up the ranks. 
Before we begin, you should be seated at all times. If you cannot see my chat, adjust your camera. 
Unless instructed to do so, leaving your seat will result in a warning. 
We will begin with the notes stage. 
In this stage, I will review the material from your last training and go over the rules you must follow as an employee member.
As a Junior Operator, you must pass this training to become a Senior Operator.
After this training, you can attend ONE more training session to become a Head Operator.
Head Operators CANNOT attend training. 
Instead, they must play the game regularly and set a good example to be promoted to the Super-vision Team.


The Super-vision Team consists of Shift Leaders, Super-visors, Assistant Managers, and General Managers.
The Super-vision Team receives moderation power at the car wash and can help out at training sessions.
If there is not a member of the Super-vision Team in your server, request one to join on the group wall or the communications server.
Moving on, I will explain the rules you must follow as a member of the employee team.
First, do not ask higher ranks if you can get promoted. This is called HINTING.
Although, asking HOW to get promoted is acceptable.
Second, do not block cars or act rudely towards customers. 
Behaving disrespectfully will result in immediate punishment. 
Third, do not challenge the authority of higher ranks.
They have the right to take any moderation action against you. 
Fourth, you must maintain professionalism at ALL TIMES.
This means acting polite and considerate of others. 
Thank you for listening. 
Anyone who violates these rules as an employee member will be demoted. Does everyone understand?
* Wait for everyone to respond.
Good, we will now move on to the drive-thru stage.




Drive-Thru Stage
In this stage, I will demonstrate how to serve a customer at the drive-thru by using a proper greeting and making their order.
In order to do this, please follow me to the demo lane. Have a seat on the BENCHES in front of the booth once we arrive.
* Walk over to the demo lane. Wait until everyone has taken a seat on the benches.
Welcome to the demo lane! Everyone will stay seated during this stage.
You will watch as our assistant and I demonstrate how to serve someone at the drive-thru.
I will be behind the register. Our assistant will drive up in a car and tell me what they would like to order.
I will make the item, hand it to them, and wish them a good day.
You will NOT be participating in this demonstration. Please sit quietly and watch closely.
* The TRAINER should stand behind a REGISTER and the ASSISTANT should drive up to the window and order something. The Junior Operators DO NOT PARTICIPATE in this demonstration. Move on once you’ve finished.
Thank you for watching!
Let’s review what you’ve learned. What do you do once a customer drives up to your register?
You may answer in chat.
* The correct answer is saying your greeting. Make sure they all answer correctly!
Good job! What are several things you should include in your greeting?
This is something you learned last training.
* They can have different answers for this one.
Excellent! 
At this point, we will sharpen our skills with greetings and move on to the greetings stage.
Let’s head back inside to begin! 
Greetings Stage
How is everyone doing so far? Are there any questions?
* Take a minute to answer questions with your assistants. Don’t take too long answering questions.
Alright, let’s begin the greetings stage.
When a customer drives up to your window, you must be prepared to greet them and ask what they would like to eat or drink.
In your last training, you learned that this is called your GREETING.
Unlike the ticket booths, you will NOT ask them what ticket they would like.
Instead, your greeting will look like this…
Hello, welcome to the Washiez Drive-Thru! What would you like to eat/drink? The menu is above. 
You have one minute to create a greeting for the drive-thru. Your minute starts now!
Once again, make sure to greet them in a friendly manner and ask what they would like to eat or drink. 
Good luck!
* After waiting one minute, make sure you and your assistants are checking greetings. Give feedback to as many people as you can! 
Thank you for your participation!
Kitchen Stage
Let’s begin the kitchen stage. 
In this stage, you will have THREE minutes to practice making food and drinks.
Please use the food and drink machines that are behind you. DO NOT leave the room.
After your time is up, I will ask everyone to report back to their seats.
Then, I will ask everyone to make a specific food or drink item.
Before you begin, those who are on a PHONE will only see THREE inventory items displayed at the bottom of their screen.
In order to see the rest of your inventory, select the three dots at the top right and then press “inventory” to see the rest of your items.
Your three minutes start now, have fun! 
* Wait three minutes. You and your assistants should be asking any questions and providing assistance to them. Move on once the three minutes are up.
Your time is up! Please take a seat.
In the next part of the kitchen stage, you will make a specific order and hand it to me.
To hand an item to me, hold out the item and use the !give command.
You may now head back to the kitchen to make me a STRAWBERRY DONUT and a LATTE. Do not leave the room!
Once you’ve handed both items to me, take a seat. 
* You and your assistants should provide assistance and make sure everyone takes their seat afterwards.
Good job! That concludes the kitchen stage.
Trivia Stage

Conclusion
Thank you everyone for participating! That concludes the final stage of our training. 
Please give us a moment to review everyone’s performance. If you did not pass, you are welcome to attend the next training.
* Pass the Junior Operators unless someone was being disruptive or were unresponsive for most of the training. Do NOT fail for grammar and do NOT review them individually.
* Use the !warn command several times on a Junior Operator to fail them.
* Avoid joking about failing everyone. Tell them they passed and move on.
Congratulations, you’ve all passed the session! Head over to the passer lines that are outside. There should be ONE person per line.
* Wait until they are standing on the lines to move on. 
Once again, make sure there is one person per line. When you have been added to the ranking queue, do not leave the game until you have been kicked. 
Thank you for choosing to be a part of our community and we hope to see you next time! 
* Say :pm admins Ranker needed Group [GROUP LETTER]. Do not make a #ranker-request unless you are the host of the session.
* Keep them on the lines and remind them to NOT leave the game. 
* Stay with your Junior Operators until they have ALL been ranked and kicked.
