Senior Operator Guide  


Review Stage
* Make sure everyone finds a seat and is in the correct group.
* As a trainer, you must keep the training going with minimal interruptions. Allow your ASSISTANTS to handle disruptions. 
Welcome to the training session! As your trainer, I will guide you through your last training at Washiez.
Before we begin, you should be seated at all times. If you cannot see my chat, adjust your camera. 
Unless instructed to do so, leaving your seat will result in a warning. 
The first stage of training will be the review stage. Listen carefully as we revisit the information you’ve learned in your past several trainings. 
During your training as a Trainee, you learned about the importance of the Super-vision Team and how they help you deal with trollers.
Remember, the first step when you encounter a troller is to give them a VERBAL warning. 
If they continue, find someone who is in the Super-vision Team.
Shift Leaders, Super-visors, Assistant Managers, and General Managers are in the Super-vision Team. They can give warnings and jail trollers.


Once you become a Head Operator, you will NOT be able to give warnings that display over a person's nametag. That’s only accessible to the Super-vision Team. 
Make sure you know how to handle a troller going forward. Remember, give them a VERBAL warning and then seek help from the Super-vision Team. 
In your training as a Junior Operator, you learned about the rules you must follow at the car wash.
These rules are to act appropriately, respect the authority of higher ranks, and to maintain a professional attitude. 
Anyone who violates these rules will be demoted. 
Does everyone understand what we have gone over? 
* Wait for everyone to respond.
Good! We’ll have a trivia on what we just reviewed before we move onto the next stage. 
The first question is…
1. What should you do if there’s a troller?
Correct Answer: You should give the troller one VERBAL warning and then contact a member of the Super-vision Team.
2. Name several ranks that are in the Super-vision Team.
Correct Answer: Shift Leaders, Super-visors, Assistant Managers, and General Managers are in the Super-vision Team.
3. What is the purpose of the Super-vision Team?
Correct Answer: The Super-vision Team can jail trollers. Once you have given a troller a verbal warning, report them to a member of the Super-vision Team.
Thank you for participating! That concludes the review stage.
Warehouse Stage 
We will now move on to the warehouse stage.
In this stage, I will demonstrate how to restock the car wash.
To begin, please follow me outside. Once we arrive, have a seat on the benches. 
* Walk over to the demo lane. Wait until everyone has taken a seat.
Let’s begin!
One of the most important duties as a Head Operator is making sure the car wash is restocked.
Inside of the car wash, there are four crates that have an indicator above them. If the indicator is on red, that means it’s time to replace the empty crate. 
To replace a crate, enter the warehouse. It’s the red brick building next to the cafe. 
Open the door to the machine and place a crate inside. The crate will fill up with water and soap. 
After the crate travels through the conveyor, it’s ready to be picked up and brought to the car wash.


Use the machine under the BLUE arrow to restock the car wash. This machine is located inside of the car wash.
Make sure to restock frequently so the car wash has enough soap and water.
Before we end the warehouse stage, I will demonstrate how to fill up a crate.
Please sit quietly and watch closely.
* You should fill up a crate, pick it up, and show it to the Senior Operators.
As demonstrated, I opened the door and placed the crate inside. 
From there, everything was done automatically and I could pick up the crate from the other end.
That concludes the warehouse stage, thank you for listening! Let’s head back inside for the notes stage.
Notes Stage
How is everyone doing so far? If you have any questions, now would be the time to ask.
* Take a minute to answer questions with your assistants. Don’t take too long answering questions.
Alright, let’s begin the notes stage.
During this stage, I will explain how to become a Shift Leader.
Listen carefully. This is VERY important information as a Head Operator.
Once you become a Head Operator, you CANNOT attend trainings anymore.
Unfortunately, you will not be able to join the training center either. 
To become a Shift Leader, you have to meet the following requirements…
✅ Earn 250 skill.
✅ Regularly play the game
✅ Display professionalism, respect for others, and the ability to effectively handle situations at the car wash
✅ Work as an employee member for a minimum of 2 weeks.
That’s it! After meeting these requirements, you can be promoted through the RECOMMENDATION PROCESS. 
The recommendation process is where the Corporate Team promotes hard working Head Operators that meet the requirements. 
You can ONLY be promoted if you’ve met the requirements and continue to work hard.
Hinting, which means to ask for a promotion, is NOT allowed.
Hinting will GREATLY reduce your chances of being promoted. 
If you have any questions or feel confused about the recommendation process in the future, do not hesitate to ask a higher rank.
That concludes the notes stage.
Trivia Stage
Let’s wrap up the training with another trivia on what you’ve just learned.
Here we go, good luck! 
1. What should you do if the car wash needs to be restocked?
Correct Answer: You should go to the warehouse, fill up a crate, and bring it back to the car wash to exchange it with an empty crate. 
2. Can you continue to attend training sessions as a Head Operator?
Correct Answer: No! Head Operator is the maximum rank you can train for.
3. What are some important characteristics you should display as a member of the employee team?
Correct Answer: Respect, professionalism, and politeness. 
4. What is hinting? Is it allowed?
Correct Answer: Hinting means to ask for a promotion. It is NOT allowed.
5. What happens once you meet the requirements?
Correct Answer: Once you meet the requirements, you have a chance at being promoted by a member of the Corporate Team. This does NOT happen immediately and will take time.
Conclusion
Thank you everyone for participating! That concludes the final stage of our training. 
Please give us a moment to review everyone’s performance. If you did not pass, you are welcome to attend the next training.
* Pass the Senior Operators unless someone was being disruptive or were unresponsive for most of the training. Do NOT fail for grammar and do NOT review them individually.
* Use the !warn command several times on a Senior Operator to fail them.
* Avoid joking about failing everyone. Tell them they passed and move on.
Congratulations, you’ve all passed the session! Head over to the passer lines that are outside. There should be ONE person per line.
* Wait until they are standing on the lines to move on. 
Once again, make sure there is one person per line. When you have been added to the ranking queue, do not leave the game until you have been kicked. 
Thank you for your participation during this session. We hope to see you next time!
* Say :pm admins Ranker needed Group [GROUP LETTER]. Do not make a #ranker-request unless you are the host of the session.
* Keep them on the lines and remind them to NOT leave the game. 
* Stay with your Senior Operators until they have ALL been ranked and kicked.
