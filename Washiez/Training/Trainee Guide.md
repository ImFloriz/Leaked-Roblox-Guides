Trainee Guide  




Notes Stage
* Make sure everyone finds a seat and is in the correct group.
* As a trainer, you must keep the training going with minimal interruptions. Allow your ASSISTANTS to handle disruptions. 
Welcome to the training session! As your trainer, I will guide you through everything you need to do in order to rank up.
Before we begin, you should be seated at all times. If you cannot see my chat, adjust your camera. 
Unless instructed to do so, leaving your seat will result in a warning. 
The first stage of training will be the notes section. Listen carefully as I explain the training procedure you will undergo during your time at Washiez.
By passing THREE training sessions, you will receive the rank Head Operator.
Each training session you attend, you will be promoted ONE rank.
By passing this training session, you will be ranked to Junior Operator and can work at the car wash.
Continue attending training sessions to work your way up the ranks.
Although, once you achieve the rank Head Operator, you will NOT be able to attend training sessions.


Instead, work hard and play the game frequently for a chance at being promoted to Shift Leader. 
Shift Leaders can use the moderation system to handle trollers at the car wash and help out at training sessions.
In future trainings, you will be given a detailed explanation of what it takes to become a Shift Leader.
It’s also important to know that the ranks at Washiez are separated into categories.
Junior Operators, Senior Operators, and Head Operators are in the Entry Team.
Shift Leaders, Super-visors, Assistant Managers, and General Managers are in the Super-vision Team.
I will explain more about the Super-vision Team later in the training and how they will be useful to you.
Greetings Stage
Thank you for listening! That concludes the notes stage.
As you begin your journey at Washiez, make sure to keep in mind what I explained. If you have any questions, feel free to ask later in the training.
We will now be moving onto the greetings stage.
The MOST IMPORTANT task as a Junior Operator is to work at the lanes.
At each lane, there is a booth with a register that allows you to hand a ticket to the customer and open the gate.
When a customer drives up to your booth, you must be prepared to greet the customer and ask them what type of ticket they would like.
This is called your greeting. Here’s an example of an acceptable greeting…
Hello, welcome to Washiez! What kind of ticket can I get you? The options are Regular, Extra, and Deluxe! 
You have one minute to prepare your greeting. Your minute starts now!
I suggest copying or writing down your greeting so you don’t forget it.
Good luck!
* After waiting one minute, make sure you and your assistants are checking greetings. Give feedback to as many people as you can! 
Thank you for participating! 
Remember, having a friendly and understandable greeting is very important.
You’re responsible for making our customers feel welcomed.
Keep that in mind when you begin working at the car wash!
Ticket Stage
That concludes the greetings stage. 
How is everyone doing so far? If you have any questions, now would be the time to ask. 
* Take a minute to answer questions with your assistants. Don’t take too long answering questions.
Alright, we will now be moving on to the ticket stage. 
In this stage, we will pretend that you’re working at a ticket booth.
You will use the greeting you just created to simulate a real scenario at the car wash.
In order to do this, please follow me to the demo lane. Once we arrive, have a seat on the benches in front of the booth. 
* Walk over to the demo lane. Wait until everyone has taken a seat.
Let’s begin.
To use the ticket system, ask what type of ticket the customer would like in your greeting.
Interact with the ticket system to select between Regular, Extra, and Deluxe.
Once you click an option, the ticket will automatically be given to the customer.
Then, open the gate to let them through. Don’t close it on them!
Now it’s time to practice when a customer drives up.
Once I approach with my car, stay seated and say your greeting as if you’re standing in the booth.
After that, I’ll tell you what type of ticket I want.
Since we don’t have time for each of you to use the ticket system individually, just say -gives ticket-.
This will indicate that you’ve given me a ticket and opened the gate for me to pass.
As a reminder, make sure to use an appropriate greeting and pretend to hand me a ticket. Please STAY SEATED the entire time. 
* Drive your car in front of them. Once they say their greetings, tell them what type of ticket you want. 


Trolling Stage
Good job! Keep up the great work as we move into the trolling stage.
In this stage, our assistant and I will demonstrate how to handle a troller.
Our assistant will be inside the ticket booth and will ask me what type of ticket I want. I will drive up in my car and pretend to be a troller.
They will give me one VERBAL warning, and then will call a member of the Super-vision Team by saying -calls ST-
ST is an abbreviation for Super-vision Team.
This will indicate that they reported me to a member of the Super-vision Team if it were a real scenario.
Once again, the Super-vision Team consists of Shift Leaders, Super-visors, Assistant Managers, and General Managers.
Before we begin, you should NOT be participating in the demonstration. Please sit quietly and watch closely.
* The TRAINER should act as the TROLLER and the ASSISTANT should act as the STAFF MEMBER. Proceed with the simulation as smoothly as possible. Move on once you’ve finished.
Thank you for watching. 
To make sure you were paying attention, what do you do once the troller has been given one VERBAL warning? 
You may answer in chat. 
Good job! After giving the troller ONE verbal warning, you must contact a member of the Super-vision Team. 
Remember, ST stands for Super-vision Team. 
The Super-vision Team will jail the troller if they continue to be uncooperative.
Trivia Stage
We will now be moving on to our last stage, trivia! 
This will be a review of everything you have learned during the session. 
Let’s head back inside of the training room to begin this stage. 
* Wait for everyone to be seated in order to proceed.
Is everyone ready to answer the trivia? 
* Wait for the Trainees to respond.
Good! Even if you’re not, you’re welcome to seek help from someone at your table. 
Answer each question out loud. Good luck!
* Ask each question and allow a majority of them to respond. Before you move on, tell them the correct answer located below the question.

Correct Answer: As a Junior Operator, you should be directing traffic, operating the gates, and working in the lanes to distribute tickets.
2. What is the highest rank you can achieve by attending training sessions?

Conclusion
Thank you everyone for participating! That concludes the final stage of our training. 
Please give us a moment to review everyone’s performance. If you did not pass, you are welcome to attend the next training.
* Pass the Trainees unless someone was being disruptive or were unresponsive for most of the training. Do NOT fail for grammar and do NOT review them individually.
* Use the !warn command several times on a Trainee to fail them.
* Avoid joking about failing everyone. Tell them they passed and move on.
Congratulations, you’ve all passed the session! Head over to the passer lines that are outside. There should be ONE person per line.
* Wait until they are standing on the lines to move on. 
Once again, make sure there is one person per line. When you have been added to the ranking queue, do not leave the game until you have been kicked. 
Thank you for your participation during this session. We hope to see you next time! 
* Say :pm admins Ranker needed Group [GROUP LETTER]. Do not make a #ranker-request unless you are the host of the session.
* Keep them on the lines and remind them to NOT leave the game. 
* Stay with your Trainees until they have ALL been ranked and kicked.
